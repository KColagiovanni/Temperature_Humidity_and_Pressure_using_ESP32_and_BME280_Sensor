# Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure(BME280 Sensor) using an ESP32 that Broadcasts Data Over MQTT

### Description:
This program was written with the intent to measure temperature, humidity, and pressure using an 
Espresif ESP32, a BME280 Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure sensor, and an optional power supply
set to 3.3V. Alternatively, a Micro USB connector can be used to power the board and sensor. The 
program sends data to the serial monitor (console output) and publishes [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/)
messages using specific topics. A Node Red program is subscribed to all the topics that are 
published and it also sends the messages to Home Assistant.

## User Guide
### Getting Started
- #### Wiring:
  * Note: The bread board rows are shorted together on the right(columns a-e) and left(columns f-j) sides.
  * ESP32 pressed into the bread board.
  * BME280 pressed into the breadboard with all of the pins in the same column.
     * Jumper wire from the pin labeled D21(SDA) on the ESP to SDA on the BME sensor.
     * Jumper wire from the pin labeled D22(SCL) on the ESP to SCL on the BME sensor.
  * If using the power supply to power the project:
     * Power supply pressed into the (+) and (-) of the bread board. Note: If the power supply if connected on the "bottom" of the bread board, the polarity marked on the bread board will be incorrect.
     * Jumper wire from (+) on the breadboard to the pin labeled VIN on the ESP32.
     * Jumper wire from (-) on the breadboard to the pin labeled GND on the ESP32.
  * Jumper wire from the pin labeled 3V3 on the ESP to "+" on the BME sensor.
  * Jumper wire from the pin lebeled GND on the ESP to "-" on the BME sensor.
  * [Optional] If using an LED to show when MQTT is connected:
     * The long side of the LED goes to GPIO 5 of the ESP32.
     * Connect the short side of the LED to one leg of the 1K Ohm resistor (both connected to the same row in the breadboard (Columns a-e or f-j)).
     * Connect the other leg of the resistor to ground(or "-" of the power supply).

- #### Setup:
    * Clone the repository by opening a terminal on personal PC that has the Arduino IDE installed on it and type: `git clone https://github.com/KColagiovanni/Temperature_and_Humidity_using_ESP32_and_BME280_Sensor.git`
    * Using the file explorer navigate to the Temperature_Humidity_andPressue_using_ESP32_and_BME280_Sensor directory and double click on the Temp_Hum_and_Psi_using_ESP32_and_BME280_sensor.ino file. This should open up a new Arduino IDE window.
    * [Install the ESP32 board add-on](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/) to Arduino IDE.
        * Install the BME package to the Arduino IDE by going to *Tools* > *Manage Libraries* and search for the *BME280* library, then click on install.
        * Install the PubSubCLient package to the Arduino IDE (used for MQTT communication) by going to *Tools* > *Manage Libraries* and search for *PubSubClient*, then click on install.
    * Set up the Arduino IDE before uploading the sketch by:
        * In the Arduino IDE select *Tools* > *Board* and select the board that is being used.
        * In the Arduino IDE select *Tools* > *Port* and select the USB/Serial port that is being used.

  ### How to Use
    * Connect the ESP32 to the personal PC using a USB A to Micro USB cable.
    * Select *Upload* in the upper left corner of the Arduino IDE. It is a circular button with an arrow pointing right.
    * Once the sketch is uploaded, power cycle the ESP32 and open the serial monitor to see board output by clicking on the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner. Note: the ESP may need to be power cycled after this to see data being displayed.
